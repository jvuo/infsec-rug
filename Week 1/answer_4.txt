===========================================================
i came to security from cryptography and thought of the problem
in a military like fashio nmost writings about security
come from this perspective and it can be summed up pretty easily
security threats are to be avoided using preventive counter
measures this is how encryption works the threat is eavesdropping
and encryption provides the prophylactic this could all be explained
with block diagrams alice is communicating with bob both are
identified by boxes and there is aline between them signifying the
communication eve is the eavesdroppers heal so is a box and has
a dotted line attached to the communications lines he is able to
intercept the communication the only way to prevent eve from
learning what alice and bob are talking about is through a
preventive countermeasure encryption theres no detection theres
no response theres no risk management you have to avoid the threat
for decades we have used this approach to computer security we draw
boxes around the different players and lines between them we
define different attackers eavesdroppers impersonators thieves
and their capabilities we use preventive countermeasures like
encryption and access control to avoid different threats if we
can avoid the threats weve won if we cant weve lost imagine my
surprise when i learned that the world doesnt work this way some
history from the vigenere wiki page the first well documented
description of a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by leon
battista alberti a round and used a metal cipher disc to switch
between cipher alphabets albertis system only switched alphabets
after several words and switches were indicated by writing the letter
of the corresponding alphabet in the cipher text later in johannes
trithemius in his work poligraphia invented the tabularecta a
critical component of the vigenre cipher the trithemius cipher
however only provided a progressive rigid and predictable system
for switching between cipher alphabets what is now known as the
vigenere cipher was originally described by giovan battista bellaso
in his book lacifradel siggiovan battista bellaso he built upon
the tabularecta of trithemius but added a repeating counter sign
a key to switch cipher alphabets every letter whereas alberti and
trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions bellasos scheme
meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily changed simply
by selecting a new key keys were typically single words or short
phrases known to both parties in advance or transmitted out of band
along with themes sage bell a sos method thus required strong
security for only the key as it is relatively easy to secure a
short key phrase say by a previous private conversation bellasos
system was considerably more secure blaisede vigenere published
his description of a similar but stronger autokey cipher before
the court of henry iii of france in later in the th century the
invention of bellasos cipher was misattributed to vigenere
david kahn in his book the code breakers lamented the misattribution
by saying that history had ignored this important contribution and
instead named a regressive and elementary cipher for him vigenere
though he had nothing to do with it the vigenere cipher gained
reputation for being exceptionally strong noted author and mathematician
charles lutwidgedodg son lewis carroll called the vigenere
cipher unbreakable in his piece the alphabet cipher in a
childrens magazine in scientific american described the vigenre
cipher as impossible of translation this reputation was not deserved
charles babbage is known to have broken a variant of the cipher as
early as however he didnt publish his work kasiski entirely
broke the cipher and published the technique in the th century
even before this though some skilled cryptanalysts could occasionally
break the cipher in the th century cryptographic sliderule used as a
calculation aid by the swiss army between and the vigenere cipher is
simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with
cipher disks the confederate states of america for example used a brass
cipher disk to implement the vigenere cipher during the american
civil war the confederacys messages were far from secret and the
union regularly cracked their messages throughout the war the
confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases
manchester bluff complete victory and as the war came to a close come
retribution gilbert vernam tried to repair the broken cipher creating
the vernam vigenere cipher in but no matter what he did the cipher
was still vulnerable to cryptanalysis vernams work however eventually
led to the one time pad a provably unbreakable cipher

ANSWERS RELATING TO THE DECRYPTION
===========================================================
The key was calculated by multiplying the frequencies
with the know letter frequencies for the English language
vector multiplication was performed using a shifting algorithm
to find the sum of products producing the largest value.
This value is assumed to be most reflective of the normal
frequencies, the number of shifts is incorporated in the key.
This gives us the following key:

KEY = [8, 13, 19, 4, 6, 17, 8, 19, 24]

The key corresponds to the following keyword:

KEYWORD = integrity

If all printable characters would be allowed the most
frequent character would most likely be the whitespace
character.
